## âœ¨ About the Project

**Inboxify** is a high-performance, production-ready newsletter delivery API built with Rust. It provides endpoints to subscribe users, confirm subscriptions, and send newsletters â€” with a strong focus on type safety, performance, and observability.

This project is designed as a learning journey inspired by the book _"Zero to Production in Rust"_ by Luca Palmieri. Along the way, it implements professional-grade practices in web backend development.
